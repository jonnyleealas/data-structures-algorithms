# How to choose which search for BST


## Breadth First Search
- Use this when we don't have to keep track of many node. The less that is in our queue the less space in memory we will use.
- Not good for wide trees.


## DFS
- Use this when we have a really wide tree.
- Deep long trees will take up more space when using DFS.

### In Order
- When making a list that is ordered

### Pre Order
- Clone or duplicate a tree
- Store or flatten a file to store in a db. It is easier to recreate later.
- Will allow us to see the root of a node.

### Post Order
