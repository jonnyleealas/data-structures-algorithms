# Big O Heaps
- O(log n) or log base 2 of n
- quick insertion and deletion
- Each time we go down a step in the tree we have double the amount of nodes.
- Every time we double the number of nodes the time increases by 1.
- Not great for searching

# Summary 
- Binary Heaps, sorting and priority queues
- They are always filled out left to right so more than likely they will be balanced.
- we can use arrays to store elements.
