# MergeSort
- split an array into smaller arrays till they are single element arrays
- Split the array to single elements and compare
    - Join arrays
    
# Big O
- O(N Log N)
- In the middle compared to most sorting algo. Not as good as linear or O(Log N) but better than O(NË†2)

# Summary
- Write a functions that merges two sorted arrays
- Another recursive function will take the mid, left , and right values
