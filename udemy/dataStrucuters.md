# Data Structures Classes and traversals
- Linked List
- Doubly linked list
- Binary Search Trees
- Different data structures excel on different things.
- Undirected Graph
- We must know when to use these different data structures.
- Arrays are given to us for free but some times we need better ways to store data.

# Data Structures Classes
- When creating data structures we need to create a class to use as a blue print for creating new sets a data for that data structure.

# Instance Methods
- Methods in a class relevant to individual instances of the class. These methods are not meant to be used within the class but are meant to be used when an instance of the class is created.
    - push, reverse, shift, get, insert, remove, pop.

# Static Methods of a class
- A utility method of a class that is not meant for an instance. 
- We call it by using a capitol letter and a dot. ClassName.method.
