# Linked List
- Elements don't have indeces
- They have pointers to the next element
- Each element is a node
    - nodes store data and reference the next node
    - Head is the beginning 
    - Tail is the end --> null
    - We keep track of length
- Random access is not allowed, in order to find something we have to check each node till we find our element.
- Great for insertion and deletion

# Singly Linked List
- Only point to the next node in front.
