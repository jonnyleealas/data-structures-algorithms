# Search
- Is an element contained in a list?
- Methods like indexOf() are searching algorithms.
- Searching through arrays and strings
- linear search on arrays
- binary search on sorted arrays
- naive string search algo
- kmp string string searching algo

# Linear Search 
- Used for arrays
- This method is O(n) because we have to go through each element search for our element.
- If it is sorted a binary search would be better.
- indexOf, includes, find, findindex, etc...--> These methods search linearly for an element
- One item at a time from beginning or end.
