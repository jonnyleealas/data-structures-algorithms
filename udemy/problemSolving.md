# Understand the problem first
- Restate it in my own words
- What are the inputs
- Do I have enough information to solve this problem?
- How should i label the pieces of data that are part of the problem? --> What are my variables named?

# Explore Examples
- Come up with my own examples of what needs to be done with the program to solve the problem.
- Given our input what is our output.
- Examples with empty input and invalid inputs can help us find solutions as well.
- Give examples with edge cases. If we look for ways that our program can break we can understand the problem better.

# Break it down
- Write out the steps you need to take.
    - Write, write, write!!!
- Pseudo Code --> Write out steps using comments.

# Summary
- Understand the problem
- Concrete examples
- Break it down in pseudo
- Simplify and solve in smaller sections then connect the dot to form ultron.
- Refactor
