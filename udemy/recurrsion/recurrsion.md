# Recursion
- Must have a base case -->  A point where the recursion stops
- Different input each time the function is called within itself(recursively)

# Example 1
- We start with our base case so that we can stop our recursive call as soon as our condition is met.
- We change our input so for our next function call to get closer to our end statement.
- We call our function again with our new modified input.

```
function countDown(num) {
    if(num <= 0){
        console.log("all done)
        return
    }
    console.log(num)
    num--
    countDown(num)
}

countDown(5)
```

# Example 2 add range of num
```
function sumRange(num){
    if(num === 1) return 1

    return num + sumRange(num - 1)
}
```
## Summary 
- The top function in the stack waits on the lower functions for the elements it can use to finish its task.
1. sumRange(3) is called and it waits for sumRange(3-1) to return with a number
1. sumRange(2) is called and waits for sumRange(2-1) to return with a number
1. sumRange(1) returns 1 over to sumRange(2)
1. sumRange(2) adds 1 which equals 3 and returns 3 over to sumRange(3) which is the top of the stack.
1. sumRange(3) adds 3 which equals 6 and returns that number to finish the call stack of the recursive function.
1. sumRange returns 6 and we are done.
```
    1) sumRange(3) --> waits for step 2 --> takes the return from step 2 and returns the sum --> recursion is finished.
        if(3 === 1) return 1

        return 3 + sumRange(3 - 1) --> Becomes 3 + (3) = 6
            2) sumRange(2) --> waits for step 3f
                if(2 === 1) return 1
                
                return 2 + sumRange(2 - 1) --> Becomes 2 + (1)= 3 --> takes step 3s return and sends the sum to step 1.
                    3) sumRange(1) --> returns int 1 to step 2
                        if(1 === 1) return 1

                        return 1 + sumRange(1 - 1) --> Becomes 1 + (1 - 1) = 1
```

# Factorial
- Instead of adding 5 then 4 then 3 then 2 then 1 we multiply.
- 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1

```

function factorial(n){
    if(n ===1){
        return 1
    }
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
}
```

# Summary factorial 
- Base case
- Return number * function(num - 1) --> This tells the program to subtract 1 from our input till it hits 1. At 1 our program will stop and return the results.


# Helper Function in Recursion
- A function that uses a recursive function within it its code block to go through a list. The outer function will return the results from its inner function.
- We can use this when we need to add to a return array from withing the outer function to avoid resetting the array to zero.
## Code Sample
- Find odds takes an array and return all odd numbers.
-  Our base case checks for the length of the array to hit zero so it can break out.
- Next we go to index 0 and check to see if the number is not even.
- If it is even we push that number into our array.
- We call the same function but this time we slice at index 1 so that we remove the element we just checked. The function will run recursively till we have go through our entire array.
- Slice takes an index input and removes everything to the left of that index. If the index is 3 it will remove indexes [0,1,2]. If The index is 2 it will slice off indexes [0,1].
- Lastly we return our array.
```
function findOdds(num){
  let array = [];

  function recursive(outerInput){
    if(outerInput.length === 0){
      return
    }
    if(outerInput[0] % 2 !== 0){
      array.push(outerInput[0])
    }
    recursive(outerInput.slice(1))

  }

  recursive(num)

  return array
}

console.log(findOdds([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]))
```

# Return the power of the exponents
- Base case - if exponent = 1 return 1
- Base * function(base, exp - 1)

## Code Example
- Function will go down recursively till the exponent is 1.
- At 1 base will become 3 and be multiplied by 3 which is 9. 9 will be returned to the next call. 9 times 3 will return 27.
```
/*
 return base * power(9, 3)
     return 3 * power(9, 2) -- 27
     return 3 * power(3, 1) -- 9

*/
function power(base, exponent){
    if(exponent === 0) return 1
    return base * power(base, exponent-1)
}
```

# Reverse an array recursively
- Base case stops the recursion when it is less than or equal to 0.
- Next slice at index 1 + add index 0. We call this functions recursively till it has sliced and added each index to the end of the array.
```

let n = [1,2,"larry"]

function reverse(str){
	if(str.length <= 1) return str;
    console.log(str)
	return reverse(str.slice(1)) + str[0];
}
reverse(n)


```
# Summary of recursion
- When our input is subtracted by 1 we can view it from the bottom up. The function goes all the way to 1 and thats where it started returning inputs to the next functions till they reach the top of the stack. So it stack from the bottom till it reaches the top. The first initialized functions get all the numbers that have been summed from starting at 1 and thats what gets returned.
