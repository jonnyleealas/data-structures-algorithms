# Array 
- why do arrays start at 0?
    - pointers are arrays in a different form
    - 0 is 0 bytes from the beginning of the array.

# What is a pointer?
- Say we have a variable x and we assign y to point to x ---> y = x
    - y in this case only has the address to where x is being stored.
    - It is pointing to the address of x.
